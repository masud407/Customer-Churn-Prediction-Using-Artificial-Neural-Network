# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Artificial-Neural-Network

**Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning**
This project involves the analysis and prediction of customer churn using a dataset from a telecommunications company. Below is an overview of the steps taken and the techniques used.
Data Preprocessing

**Dataset:**
Kostas Diamantaras. (2020). Customer Churn Prediction 2020. Kaggle. https://kaggle.com/competitions/customer-churn-prediction-2020

**1.	Loading and Initial Inspection**
•	Load the data and inspect a random sample to understand its structure.

**2.	Data Cleaning**
•	Remove the customerID column and convert TotalCharges to numeric, handling any non-numeric values.

**3.	Handling Categorical Data:**
•	Simplify and encode categorical data for analysis.

**4.	Feature Scaling**
•	Scale numerical features to a range between 0 and 1.

**5. Data Analysis and Visualization**
•	Visualizing Churn Based on Tenure and Monthly Charges

**6. Model Building**
1.	Splitting the Data:
2.	Building and Training the Model
   
**7. Evaluation**
•	Model Evaluation

**8. Handling Imbalanced Data**
Techniques Applied:
•	Under sampling: Balancing the dataset by reducing the number of majority class samples.
•	Oversampling: Using techniques like SMOTE to generate synthetic data for the minority class.
•	Use of Ensemble with under-sampling

Summary
This project showcases various techniques for preprocessing, analyzing, and modeling customer churn data. By implementing these methods, we aim to build a robust predictive model to identify customers likely to churn, enabling proactive measures to retain them.
